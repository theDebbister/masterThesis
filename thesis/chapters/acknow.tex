\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
First of all, I'd like to thank my supervisor Tanja Samardžić. She did a great job at encouraging me throughout the process of working on this thesis and providing me with important knowledge whenever I needed inspiration. Her passion for using precise and understandable language helped me a great deal to pin down the most important insights. I was lucky to have another co-supervisor, Steven Moran. His in-depth knowledge of Unicode, PHOIBLE and the IPA was an indispensable help to find my way through the sometimes messy phonetic data.

In order to digitize some of the text I used that was only available as a pdf scan, there were different people that helped me out. I would like to thank Phillip Ströbel from the CL institute at the UZH for his help with OCR technologies. Florina Vogel and Gazal Hakimifard for helping me with the Farsi transcription. Olga Sozinova from the ``Language and Space'' lab at UZH helped me with both Japanese and Russian transcription. Lysander Jakobi for digitizing the Hebrew orthographic transcription. Finally, I would like to thank Ximena Gutierrez who is part of the ``Language and Space'' lab at UZH as well and who pointed me to suitable Python libraries for tokenizing different scripts.

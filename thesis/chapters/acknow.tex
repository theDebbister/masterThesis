\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
First of all, I'd like to thank my supervisor Tanja Samardžić. She did a great job at encouraging me throughout the process and providing me with important knowledge whenever I needed inspiration. Her passion for using precise and understandable language helped me a great deal to pin down the most important insights in an comprehensible way. I was so lucky as to have another co-supervisor, Steven Moran. His in-depth knowledge of Unicode, PHOIBLE and the IPA was an indispensable help to find a way through the jungle of messy data.

In order to digitize some of the text I used that was only available as a scan, there were different people that help me out. I would like to thank Phillip Ströbel from the CL institute at the UZH for his help with OCR technologies. Lysander Jakobi for digitizing the Hebrew orthographic transcription. Florina Vogel and Gazal Hakimifard for helping with the Farsi transcription. Olga Sozinova helped me with both Japanese and Russian. Ximena Gutierrez pointed me to suitable Python libraries for tokenizing different scripts.

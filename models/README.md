# MODELS

This folder contains everything relating the models I trained including the evaluation scores.

The requirements file contains the python dependencies for the virtual environment.
Note that I used tensorflow version 1.13.1 and tensor2tensor 1.7.0.

The folder full_prediction_output contains all predicted outputs for 
all languages for each model in a separate file.

The scripts folder contains the bash scripts I used to train and evaluate the models. 
The data and model paths need to be changed.

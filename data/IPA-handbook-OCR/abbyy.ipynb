A journal entitled DM Fon&tik Titcer was started in May of that year, under the editorship of Paul Passy. It was a unique periodical, in that its contents were printed entirely in phonetic transcript. At first the Association concerned itself mainly with phonetics as applied to the teaching of English, but the membership was international from the very start. (Incidentally, Otto Jespersen became a member in June, 1886, Wilhelm Vietor in July, 1886, Henry Sweet and J. A. Lundell in September, 1886.) Soon a demand arose for phonetic texts in languages other than English, and for articles dealing with general phonetic problems. The first of these texts (French and German) were published in the May, 1887, issue of the journal, the title of which was then printed for the first time as dhd fonetik titcor. 1 The administration of the Association was at first left in the hands of a Committee of members resident in Paris. It became clear, however, after a short time, that it would be preferable to elect an International Council to look after the Association’s affairs. The Committee was accordingly replaced by an International Council in 1888, and the policy and work of the Association have been guided by such a Council ever since. During the first two years of the Association’s activity a tentative system of phonetic transcription was employed by the editor. This gave place to another tentative scheme in January, 1888. During those years the Association had no particular policy in regard to transcription, and contributors to the journal used various systems in their articles. The idea of establishing a phonetic alphabet which should be applicable to all languages was first put forward by Otto Jespersen in a letter to Paul Passy which was reproduced in DM Fonetik Titter, June, 1886. This idea was taken up with enthusiasm 1 Prom September, 1887, to July, 1888, the title was printed as da fonetik tit cor, and from August to December, 1888, as bo fonetik tUcor. [continued on p. 3 of cover Principles of the I PA (1949) 301 INTEKNATIONAL PHONETIC ASSOCIATION 1 THE INTERNATIONAL PHONETIC ALPHABET 1. The alphabet of the Association Phonetique Internationale is an alphabet on romanic basis designed primarily to meet practical linguistic needs, such as putting on record the phonetic or phonemic structure of languages, furnishing learners of foreign languages with phonetic transcriptions to assist them in acquiring the pronunciation, and working out romanic orthographies for languages written in other systems or for languages hitherto unwritten. Numerous symbols and marks are also provided, by means of which many minute shades of sound may be represented, and which thus render the alphabet well suited for use in scientific investigations, e.g. in dialectology, in the historical study of languages, and in comparative philology. 2. The alphabet is intended particularly for writing connected texts. Consequently, in its construction attention has been paid not only to the appropriateness of each letter from a phonetic point of view, but also to the suitability of letters from the psycho logical and pedagogical angles and as regards typographical harmony, the needs of the printer and written forms. 3. The construction and use of the International Phonetic Alphabet are guided by the following principles : (a) When two sounds occurring in a given language are employed for distinguishing one word from another, they should whenever possible be represented by two distinct letters without diacritical marks. Ordinary roman letters should he used as far as may be practicable, but recourse must be had to new letters when those of the roman alphabet are inadequate. (b) When two sounds are so near together acoustically that there is no likelihood of their being employed in any language for distinguishing words, they should, as a rule, be represented by the same letter. Separate letters or diacritical marks may, how ever, be used to distinguish them in “ narrow ” transcriptions or in scientific investigations. (c) The non-roman letters of the International Phonetic Alphabet have been designed as far as possible to har monise well with the roman letters. The Association does not recognise makeshift letters ; it recognises only letters which have been carefully cut so as to be in harmony with the other letters. For instance, the Greek letters included in the International Alphabet are cut in roman adaptations. Thus, since the ordinary shape of the Greek letter does not harmonise with roman type, in the International Phonetic Alphabet it is given the form p.

(d) It is not possible to dispense entirely with diacritical marks. The Association Phonetique Internationale recommends that their use be limited as far as possible to the following cases : (i) For denoting length, stress, andintonation (see §§ 31-36). (ii) In representing particular members of phonemes. (iii) When the introduction of a single diacritic obviates the necessity for designing a number of new letters (as, for instance, in the representation of nasalised vowels ; see § 30). (iv) For representing minute shades of sound in scientific investigations. (e) In applying the alphabet to any particular language, regard should be had to two fundamental phonetic principles: the theory of “ phonemes ” and the theory of “ cardinal sounds ” and especially “ cardinal vowels ”. PHONEMES 4. The nature of a “phoneme ’’and the difference between a pho neme and a speech-sound may beillustrated by concrete examples, such as the following taken from various languages. The three k-sounds of the English words keep, cart, and cool can be heard to be different; one can also easily feel the differences in their manner of formation. Nevertheless, from the linguistic point of view they count as if they were one and the same. We write them phonetically with the same letter k, since nothing is to be gained by using separate letters for them. The same applies to the French k-sounds in qui, car, cou, which differ somewhat from the corresponding English ones. Similarly the sound q counts as being “ a kind of n ” in such lan guages as Italian, Spanish, Czech, Hungarian, where it occurs only before such consonants as k, g, or x—positions from which ordinary n is excluded. (In English and German, however, q is not “ a variety of n ” ; n and q are separate phonemes, as is shown by the existence of such pairs of words as sin and sing.) The “ clear 1 ” used by many Southern English people before vowels (as in leaf, look) and the “ dark 1 ” used before consonants and finally (as in field, feel, kettle) likewise constitute a single phoneme. These varieties of 1, being determined exclusively by their situation, count as if they were one and the same sound, and they are represented adequately by the single letter 1. So also with the French ordinary 1 (as in Id) and the “ breathed ” 1 (used when such a word as ancle terminates a Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. 30 Jun 2021 at 16:11:33, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use. PrncpissoftheIrA (1949) 303 INTERNATIONAL PHONETIC ASSOCIATION 3 sentence); the sounds are acoustically very different, but as their use is determined by their situation they constitute a single phoneme, and can be represented unambiguously by the letter L The initial sounds of the Japanese words hito, hata, Huzi, 1 differ greatly from each other; the first resembles the German 9 of ich, the second is an ordinary h, and the third is a “ bi-labial ” f (<]>). The use of these sounds is, however, entirely conditioned by the following vowels; to a Japanese, 9 is “ the kind of h ” he uses before i, while $ is the “ kind of h ” he uses before u; the three sounds belong therefore to a single phoneme and may be represented by the single letter h—as is, indeed, done in modern Japanese romanic orthography. 5. The grouping of vowel sounds into phonemes is illustrated by the following examples. In Danish there are several distinct members of the a-phoneme; in particular there is a fairly “forward” one in such a word as sand (san’) and a “backer” variety in a word like sang (sag’) when a velar consonant follows in the same syllable. In Russian there are many varieties of a ; a “ middle ” one is used in sat (can), a ver y forward one in pjatj (iihtb), a very back one in the first syllable of 'palka (naJiua), a some what “ centralised ” one in the second syllable of xara'Jb (xopoino), and a completely central one (o) in the first syllable of the same word. But they all count linguistically as if they were the same sound ; they belong to the same phoneme, and may be represented unambiguously in phonetic transcription by the same letter a, In writing Pekingese romanically the letter e may be used to represent sounds of the a or a-types as well as sounds of the e-type. These latter occur only next to i or y, as in the syllables lie, fei, ye, whereas sounds of the a and A-types occur exclusively in positions other than these, e.g. in such syllables as sAg, san, fA, gA ; if this is under stood, these latter syllables can be written unambiguously with the letter e (seg, sen, fe, ge). 2 6. In languages where there are consistent relationships between vowel-length and vowel-quality, two vowel qualities may be con sidered as belonging to a single phoneme, the quality being con ditioned by the length. Thus, in transcribing normal Southern English we may write feet and fit as fi;t, fit, using the same letter i but with the length-mark in the first word. 3 Similarly, we may write the Dutch words taak and talc phonetically as ta:k and tak with the 1 In old romanisation Fuji. ! e is in fact the letter employed in such syllables in the system of romanisation known as Gwoyou Bomatzyh ('kuo,y 'luo^ma'tsa). 3 We cannot do this in types of English such as American and Scottish, in which there are no consistent relationships between vowel quality and length.

      "304 Journal of the International Phonetic Association: The International Phonetic Alphabet 4 THE PRINCIPLES OE THE convention that the long a: has a front sound and the short a a back one. 7. Phonemes are thus families of related sounds which count linguistically in a given language, as if they were one. 8. When two sounds belong to two separate phonemes in a given language, they may distinguish one word from another in that language, and separate letters must be assigned to them in phonetic transcriptions of it. Thus, n and g must be represented by separate letters in writing English and German, though such a distinction is not required in transcriptions of Italian, Spanish, or Hungarian. Similarly, two sounds of the e-type, e and e, have to be distinguished iu French, Italian, Burmese, and Tswana, though in Spanish and Russian similar sounds occur which do not need to be differentiated in writing. Examples are : French ne (nez), he (natt), Italian venti (twenty), vsnti (winds), Burmese me (remain), _ns (region). On the other hand, though Russian contains a “ close ” e (as in pjetj, neTb, for instance) and an “ open ” e (as in 'etat, otgt, for instance), the use of these sounds is conditioned by the phonetic context; consequently the two vowels do not have to be repre sented by separate symbols in “ broad ” transcriptions. CARDINAL SOUNDS 9. It is not possible to design letters for the representation of all distinguishable shades of sound. Most letters, therefore, not only represent particular sounds but also have to do duty for other shades of sound near to these. Hence the need for establishing systems of “ cardinal ” sounds. The principle is of particular value in the case of vowels, and is indeed essential for their classification, for their comparison, and for establishing the best methods of representing them in writing. 10. A convenient system of cardinal vowels consists of a series of eight basic vowels of known formation and acoustic qualities, which serve as a standard of measurement, and by reference to which other vowels can be described. The selection of these eight cardinal vowels is based upon the principle that no two of them are so near to each other as to be incapable of distinguishing words. These eight vowels are represented by the letters ieEaaoou. Cardinal i is the “ closest ” possible “ front ” vowel; if the tongue were in a higher position the sound produced would be a con sonant (fricative j). Cardinal a is the “ openest ” of the “ back ” vowels ; if the tongue were retracted further, a fricative consonant of the type b would result. Cardinal e, e, a are vowels of the “ front ” series intermediate between i and a; they are selected so that the degrees of acoustic separation i-e, e-e, E-a, a-o are Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. 30 Jun 2021 at 16:11:33, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use. Principles of the I PA (1949) 305 INTERNATIONAL PHONETIC ASSOCIATION 5 approximately equal. Cardinal o, o, u are vowels of the “ back ” series continuing the same scale of equal degrees of acoustic separation. 11. The positions of the tongue in the articulation of cardinal i, a, a and u have been determined by X-ray photographs. 1 When the highest parts of the tongue are marked with dots in these photo graphs, they have been found to have the positional relationships shown in Fig. 1. • u s® @o Open Em 1 12. The tongue positions of e and e are intermediate between those of i and a, and the tongue positions of o and o are intermediate between those of a and u. For practical linguistic purposes we can thus establish a “ vowel figure ” of the type shown in Fig. 2, which can be used for describing vowels which differ from these cardinal sounds. For instance, a dot placed on the figure half-way between the dots representing e and s will denote a vowel sound half-way in acoustic quality between cardinal e and cardinal £. 1 The original photographs may be seenizi the Department of Phonetics, University College, London. Small scale reproductions are given in the frontispiece to The Pronunciation of English by D. Jones (new edition, Cambridge University Press). Larger reproductions of the X-ray photographs of cardinal i, a and u were published in the Proceedings of the Royal Institution, Vol. XXII, pp. 12,13 (19X9)..

Secondary Cardinal Vowels. In tlie articulation of the above-mentioned eight cardinal vowels the lips are in the positions which most commonly accompany the tongue positions. Thus, i, e, £, a and a have “ spread ” or “ neutral ” lip articulations, while o, o and u are formed with different degrees of “lip-rounding”. A set of secondary cardinal vowels consists of vowels having the same tongue positions but different lip positions. In the alphabet of the Association Phonetique Internationale these are denoted by the letters y, 0, ce, —, p, a, y, hi. They are arranged on the vowel figure in the same manner as the primary cardinal vowels, i.e. as shown in Fig. 3. 14. Cardinal y and 0 have the tongue positions of cardinal i and e combined with “ close ” lip-rounding. Cardinal ce has the tongue position of cardinal e combined with “ open ” lip-rounding. Cardinal p has the tongue position of cardinal a combined with “ open ” lip-rounding. Cardinal a, y, tit have the tongue positions of cardinal o, o, u combined with lip-spreading. No symbol has been adopted for a vowel having the tongue position of cardinal a com bined with lip-rounding, since this sound has not as yet been found to occur in any language as a phoneme separate from oe. 15. It is convenient to fix two other cardinal vowels with tongue positions intermediate between those of i and u. They are denoted by i and a, i having spread lips and a rounded lips. 16. Central Vowels. Vowels situated on the line i-a or near to it are the “ front ” vowels, so-called on account of their manner of formation by the tongue; those situated on the line a n or slightly in advance of it are the “ back ” vowels. As the distance between i and u (in terms of tongue position) is much greater than the distance between a and a, it will be seen from Fig. 4 that there is an area roughly triangular in shape which separates the front and back Front Back Pig. 4 PiG. S Front Back Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. 30 Jun 2021 at 16:11:33, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use. Principles of the I PA (1949) 307 INTERNATIONAL PHONETIC ASSOCIATION 7 series of vowels. Vowels formed with the highest part of the tongue in this triangular area are called “ central ” vowels. PRINCIPLES OP VOWEL REPRESENTATION 17. The Association Phonetique Internationale recommends that in transcribing any particular language the letters ieeaaoou, y ij ce b a v in, i e be used, as far as may be practicable, to denote vowels situated in the various areas shown in Pigs. 4 and 5. This general recommendation is, however, subject to considerations mentioned in §§ 19-21. 18. The Association also recommends that the letter a be employed to denote any unrounded vowel situated in the interior triangle (see Pig. 4). If a language contains two unrounded central vowels, it is recommended that a be used to denote the closer one and v for the opener one. Occasionally the form 3 may be employed to represent another variety of central vowel. 19. In broad transcriptions the different members of a vowel phoneme should all be represented by the same letter, notwith standing that the sounds may be situated in different cardinal areas. For instance, although the Russian e-phoneme includes sounds in the cardinal areas marked e and e in Fig. 4, nevertheless the single letter e is adequate for representing the sounds in broad transcription. 20. When a vowel is situated in an area designated by a non roman letter, it is recommended that the nearest appropriate roman letter be substituted for it in ordinary broad transcriptions if that letter is not needed for any other purpose. For instance, if a language contains an e but no e, it is recommended that the letter e be used to represent it. This is the case, for instance, in Japanese. Similarly, in broad transcriptions of Southern British English the vowels in coat, caught, cot may all be written with the same letter o, thus ou, o:, o, although the two latter sounds are in the o and » areas. (In a slightly narrow transcription they might be written ou, a:, o, in a still narrower one ou, o:, d.) 21. As sounds of the d type have considerable acoustic similarity to those in the o and a areas, it is generally advisable to represent them by one of these more familiar symbols, or in some cases by one of the ordinary roman letters o or a. For instance, in transcribing Southern British English the D-sound in hot may be written o (or in broad transcriptions o) without a length-mark, while in tran scribing Hungarian it may be written a (or in broad transcription a) without a length-mark. 22.

It is recommended that the use of these additional letters should be as far as possible limited to languages in which the sounds in question occur as phonemes separate from sounds appropriately represented by adjoining cardinal symbols. It is, for instance, necessary to make use of the letter i in transcribing Scottish English or General American, since in both those types of English the sound occurs as a phoneme distinct from i and e, 2 23. Occasionally there is need for a symbol to represent a vowel intermediate between o and 0, The letter e is recommended for this purpose. ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE VOWEL SYMBOLS 24.

In connexion with the consonant letters included in the chart on p. 13 it is recommended that the following principles be observed : (a) As with vowels (§ 20), it is desirable to substitute more familiar consonant letters for less familiar ones, when such a sub stitution can be made without causing ambiguity. For instance, in a language containing a retroflex J; but no dental t the sound could generally be denoted by t. And in a language such as Tswana, which contains <j> but not Iabio-dental f, the letter f may be used to denote the sound. So also, as the sound nj is not known to occur otherwise than as a member of the m-phoneme, it can, Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. 30 Jun 2021 at 16:11:33, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use. Principles of the I PA (1949) 313 INTERNATIONA! PHONETIC ASSOCIATION 13 as a rule, be written with m (with the appropriate convention). Several other examples are given below. (6) The letter i is employed to denote both fricative r and the r-like frictionless continuant, since the two sounds have not been found to exist as separate phonemes in any language. When the latter sound occurs both consonantally and syllabically (as a vowel) in the same language, the two uses may be distinguished by the letters r and j respectively. (c) The letter j is employed to denote both the fricative and frictionless sounds, since the two varieties have not been found to exist as separate phonemes in any language. The same applies to y and ir. {d) The letter k may denote the fully rolled sound with two or more flaps of the uvula or the single-flap sound. In a language containing the two sounds as separate phonemes, the notation er is recommended for the fully rolled sound. (e) The letter r may, when convenient, replace j, r or k in the transcription of a language containing one of these three sounds but not a rolled lingual r. (/) The flapped sound r can generally be represented by r. In a language such as Spanish, where the single flap and the fully rolled sound occur as separate phonemes, the notation rr is recommended for the fully rolled sound. (g) In accordance with the principle enunciated in (a) above, the sound can generally be represented by the letter x. This cannot, however, be done in such languages as Eskimo or Kabardian, where the velar and uvular sounds occur as separate phonemes. (h) Similarly, voiced h can generally be denoted by the letter h instead of the special symbol ii. (i) The letters ji, A may be used to denote the cardinal palatal sounds (i.e. those corresponding exactly to i and j) or to acoustically indistinguishable sounds with more alveolar articula tion (i.e. corresponding to g, £.). (j) The more familiar letters J, 3 may be used to denote the sounds g, \\ in languages like Pekingese, which contain these sounds and do not contain the more usual varieties of /, 3. The letters J, 3 may also he used to denote palatalised varieties of J, 3 when these do not occur as phonemes separate from non-palatalised J, 3. OTHER LETTERS 28.

When, as in narrow transcription of Russian, separate letters are needed to denote ordinary g and advanced g, it is recommended that the form g be used for the ordinary sound and the form g (or . preferably g) for the advanced one.

In order to keep the number of letters in the phonetic alphabet within reasonable limits, the Association PhonAtique Internationale recommends the occasional use of digraphs, i.e. sequences of two letters to represent single sounds. The following are the chief cases in which digraphs may be employed with advantage : (a) To represent affricate consonants, e.g. pf, bv, ts, dz, tj, dg, tjs, kx. If a language contains affricates as well as such sequences Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. 30 Jun 2021 at 16:11:33, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use. Principles of the I PA (1949) 315 INTEBNATIONAL PHONETIC ASSOCIATION 15 as t -j- s, t -j- J, the affricates may be denoted by ligature forms such as b, dz, tfriij, or by the use of a linking mark _ or thus ts, tj, etc., or ts, tj, etc. Another plan is to retain the notation ts, dz, tj, etc., for the affricates, and to insert a hyphen (t-s, d-z, t-J, etc.) when the t and s, d and z, t and J, etc., are separately pronounced. This latter system is convenient for the transcrip tion of such a language as English, where the affricate t J is common and the sequence t + J is rare. It is often desirable (e.g. in the representation of Indian languages) to represent the affricates tj and dg by single letters ; the letters c and j may generally be used for this purpose. Occasionally the affricates ts, dz also need representation by single letters; the special symbols $ and 2 are recommended for use in such cases. (In a language such as Marathi, which contains affricate dz but no z, the letter z may be used in place of 2 in accordance with the principle in § 27 (a).) Doubled affricates may he represented thus ttj, tts, etc. (except in languages where dental t may be followed by affricate tj, etc.), or thus ec, S3, etc. (b) To represent aspirated consonants, when these have to be distinguished from corresponding “ non-aspirated ” sounds. Aspirated consonants may be represented thus, ph, th, etc. (c) To represent the “ aspirated s ” of Burmese, Shan, Korean, etc., which may be adequately rendered by sh, (d) To represent laterally exploded t and d (as in Bantu languages); these may, without ambiguity, be represented by tl, dl. {e) To represent voiceless nasal consonants, when these occur as separate phonemes ; they may be written hm, hn, hji, hr). (/) To represent “ r-coloured ” vowels, i.e. vowels pronounced with retroflex modification or with other types of tongue retrac tion producing a similar acoustic effect. These sounds may be represented by vowel letters followed by j, thus ai, or, u.i. The a may sometimes be replaced by r in accordance with the principle in § 27 (a), r-coloured a may be rendered by ar or simply by i (or when convenient ar or r). For another method of representing these sounds see end of § 28. (g) To represent various consonants with double articulation, such as the labio-velars of \"West Africa which may be written kp, gb, ijm.

This may be done by adding j, thus tj, sj, etc. (which == t,, §, etc., § 28). When a j follows a palatalised consonant, as sometimes happens in Russian, the sequences may be written tjj, sjj, etc. When a sequence composed of a non-palatalised consonant -f- j occurs in such a language, a hyphen may be inserted to show this, e.g. H s-j. (j) To represent “ front labialisation ” (palatalisation with lip-rounding); this may be shown by adding q, e.g. bi[ as in Pedi bqale (now). (Jfe) To represent nasalised vowels ; for instance it may some times be found convenient (especially in phonetic orthography) to write aq or aq, eg or eq, in place of a, i, etc. (,l) To represent vowels pronounced with “ breathy voice ” (h-coloured vowels); this may be indicated by adding h, thus eh, ah, etc. Another method of denoting h-coloured vowels is to superpose the aspiration sign, thus e, a, etc. DIACRITICAL MARKS 30. The following diacritical marks are recommended for use when necessary. ~ nasalisation : a, I = nasalised a, e. o breath : r = breathed r ; b, d, g are weak voiceless plosives (“ mediae ”). w voice : for instance s may be used to represent z in languages such as Spanish, in which z only occurs incidentally as a member of the s-phoneme. \" central vowel: I = i, U = «. e is intermediate between e and y. o = e (intermediate between a and o), etc. The use of ” is to he recommended when the vowels are special members of back or front vowel phonemes. . (below a letter) denotes a close variety : e = a specially close variety of e. This may also be indicated by the mark J - placed after or under the letter, thus ej- or e. ( open variety : e = a specially open variety of e. This may also be indicated by the mark r placed after or under the letter, thus er or e. + advanced variety. The mark may be placed either after or under the letter ; thus an advanced variety of a may be represented by a+ or a, an advanced k by k+ or k (another way of writing *). - Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. 30 Jun 2021 at 16:11:33, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use.

The mark may be placed either after or under the letter ; thus a retracted variety of a may bo repre sented by a- or a. The sign « is an alternative to -; it is intended for use more particularly when - might be taken for a hyphen. When it is desired to show in writing that t, d, n are alveolar and not dental, the retraction sign, in the form -, may be placed underneath, thus t, d, n. u dental articulation. When it is desired to show in writing that t, d, n, etc., are dental and not alveolar, this sign may be placed underneath, thus t, d, n, etc. This may also be shown by +. w labialization : n — n with simultaneous lip-rounding. ’ (above a letter) denotes palatalization : z ~ g. 5 lips more rounded : o> = an over-rounded o ; a> = u. < lips more spread : ut = a variety of u resembling m. r weak aspiration after p, t, etc. (see § 29 (b)). ’ glottal stop simultaneously or almost simultaneously with another sound, e.g. Hausa p’, t’, s’, etc.; on vowels as in Danish en (e’n), on continuant consonants as in Danish fern- (fern’). synchronic articulation : kp — k and p pronounced simultaneously, aa is one method of symbolising r-coloured a. It is generally possible to omit the sign (see § 29 (/), (</)). _ (or may also be used to indicate affricate consonants, see§ 29 (a). Small index letters may be used to indicate shades of sound.

' indicates that the following syllable has strong stress, e.g. Eng. 'inkriis (noun), in'kriis (verb). indicates that the following syllable has medium stress, e.g. 'kambi'neijn (combination), ken^ida'reijn (consideration). TONES 32. To indicate “ tones ” (voice pitches) in tone languages the Association Phonetique Internationale recommends the use of signs which, by their shapes and positions, give some indication of their musical values. Such indications can usually be effected by means of horizontal and oblique accents, thus : high level tone a low level tone a high rising tone a low rising tone a high falling tone a low falling tone a rising-falling tone a falling-rising tone a The accents may be placed either over and under the vowels, as above, or at the beginnings of syllables, thus ~pa, pa, 'pa, etc. The latter method is generally to be preferred in transcribing mono syllabic languages. 33. When a language contains only one rising tone, high or low, it is recommended that the superscript' be employed to represent it. Similarly, when a language contains only one falling tone, it may be represented by'. 34. Mid level tones can generally be left unmarked. 35. Occasionally it may be found desirable, especially in “ narrow ” tone marking, to introduce other marks such as j; ”, For instance, if in a language containing high-rising and low-rising tonemes the tones are subject to raisings and lowerings in particular contexts, it may be necessary to use a specially shaped mark such as j to denote the low-rising toneme : J pa might thus denote the syllable pa pronounced with a raised variety of that toneme, being thus distinguished in transcription from 'pa, the same syllable said with the common value of the high-rising toneme. “ and v (preceding the syllable) have been suggested for the two rising tones of Annamese, “ implying the use of breathy voice and v creaky voice. Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. 30 Jun 2021 at 16:11:33, subject to the Cambrid g e Core terms of use . Principles of the I PA (1949) 319 INTEKNATIONAL PHONETIC ASSOCIATION 19 36. In languages like Swedish and Norwegian, where the tones are linked with stress and vary in value according to the intonation of the sentence, it is necessary to adopt conventional tone-marks. For instance, the ordinary stress-mark 1 may he taken in Swedish to mean the “ simple tone ” (as in 'andan, the duck), while an arbitrarily chosen mark such as x or v must be employed to designate the “ compound tone ” (as in v andan, the spirit). Sometimes, in words of three or more syllables, it is necessary to indicate by a mark, generally the syllable upon which the second element of a compound tone falls. F0RTHER IMPROVEMENTS 37. The Association Phonetique Internationale does not claim that its alphabet is either complete or perfect. The forms of some letters may be susceptible of improvement, and it may be necessary to invent new signs either for newly discovered sounds or to distinguish shades of sound hitherto left undistinguished. Suggestions for improvement are made from time to time by members of the Association and are discussed by the Council and in Le Maitre Phonetique ; none are definitely adopted without careful considera tion and the vote of a majority of the Council. 38. Among suggestions lately made we may mention the following r has been proposed as a sign to denote that a stop consonant has no plosion (as in Burmese, Cantonese, etc.), h and a have been suggested as general symbols denoting any consonant or vowel respectively, ir has been suggested to denote the voiceless labio dental plosive, s to denote voiceless r, hi to denote voiceless m. The length-mark : is not considered entirely satisfactory, but none of the alternatives hitherto proposed seem any better. It has been proposed that K and 9 might well be replaced by the symbols g and g which suggest the Arabic signs for these sounds ( e . . The Association’s treatment of a and a as different letters denoting different sounds has not met with the success originally hoped for. In practice it is found that authors and printers still generally regard the two forms as variants of the same letter. The difficulty might be solved by altering the value of ee and assigning this letter to cardinal vowel No. 4 (and sounds near to it), leaving cardinal vowel No. 5 (and sounds near to it) to be represented by a or a according to the fount of type employed. This would involve designing a new letter to replace our present se ; n has been suggested for this.

Ganda [The consonants are laxly articulated, p, t, k sligktly aspirated, t, d alveolar. Voiced plosives are fully voiced, b is plosive after m and when double ; otherwise it = p. It has to be distinguished from w and from v and from bw (= pw). r and 1 denote r-like and 1-like sounds ; they belong to a single phoneme, r being used exclusively after i and e. j denotes a sound between cardinal j and ct;. The g of gj is very advanced, but less so than cardinal j. Precise values of vowels : ir, ex, a-, or, ur. Tones : high (marked ~), high-falling (marked '), low (unmarked). The pitch difference between high and low does not as a rule exceed a major third. A high tone following a low tone is only about a semitone higher; and a high tone following ' is about a semitone higher than the end of it. Consequently the general pitch level of the sentence gradually descends. A higher level is, or may be, resumed after a pause. A final\" is quite low, though not so low as a final unmarked syllable. Before a non-final pause the high and low tones are replaced by a rising tone ; for instance, the i of ntl in the text has a rise. v before a non-final pause ends with a slight rise. Vowels preceding a non-final pause are rather long. All full lengths of vowels are marked in this text. Some vowel lengths are significant, but others are determined by rules. The nasal consonants of mb, nd, etc., are syllabic initially. After a vowel these nasals are not syllabic, but the vowel (whether in the same word or in a preceding word) is long. Double consonants have to be distinguished from single consonants initially as well as medially. Their first elements are syllabic and bear tones. For instance, the initial d of ddala has low tone (involving, therefore, a lowering of the a’s, as compared with the high tones in jaimusuggira), while the first g in naggja:mu has high tone (which means that the syllable g ja: has the same pitch as na). When a double consonant is voiceless, the tone of the initial part is present subjectively, and its value is shown by the pitch of the next following high tone ; thus, the tone of the syllabic k in nakkiriza is known to be high, since the pitch of the ki is on the same level as that of na.

Unmarked syllables normally have mid pitch, but in penultimate syllables of statements there is a fall from mid to low, while in final syllables of all types of sentence the tone is low. There exists also a falling tone on final syllables (not exemplified in this text); it may be denoted by v means that all following syllables in the sentence or sense-group are at a slightly lower pitch than those preceding. Thus, the two high tones in ikile are slightly lower than those of phifo. These lowerings are semantically important.

Occasionally a high tone is necessarily slightly higher than a preceding high tone ; this is shown by prefixing A to the syllable containing the higher tone.

Bracketed letters denote sounds which are commonly omitted in connected speech. The tones are indicated broadly. - denotes high, with rising variants, = extra high, v high falling. Unmarked syllables have mid or low tone, with rising and falling variants. The most noteworthy variants depend upon the consonants beginning the syllables, m, n, ji, 1, r, j, w have the effect of raising the tones ; they generally convert the high tone into a high rise. They and 6 and the voiceless consonants also convert the mid tone into a high fall similar to, though distinct from,b, d, dg, j, g, lj, v, z, y, and fi. have a lowering effect on the tones; they give to ” a mid rising value, to ' a low rise- fall value, and to the mid tone a low level value. There are other variations of tone due to the character of adjoining tones and to the position of the syllable in the sentence. For instance, the mid tone tends to he low in final syllables. High tones following a mid tone are not so high as those preceding. There are occasional essential lowerings not determined by a preceding mid tone; these are indicated by \\] umoja nslaigga 6a6ephlldsa:na omip(e) esithi unamanlj(a) aggaphezu kwomgis. kwsza umfia:mbi S mhath(g) Trjgu:6(o) efudumeleqo. fiavumslama ukuthi, ojena wokufa:l(a) onokume:nz(a) umfiaimbi ajikhulul(e) Iggmfio ja:khe, ggojsna Vnamain^a. umoja Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. 30 Jun 2021 at 16:11:33, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use.

World Orthography The value of the special letters of the International Phonetic Alphabet in the construction of alphabets for various languages has been recognised by those responsible for the system known as “ World Orthography The World Orthography alphabet is identical with that of the Association Phonetique except that j and y are taken to have their English consonantal values. 1 World Orthography is now in use for the practical writing of many languages of Africa, including Dinka in the Sudan, and Igbo, Efik, Twi, and Ewe in West Africa. The system is described and exemplified in The Practical Orthography of African Languages, published by the Oxford University Press for the International African Institute. The methods of applying World Orthography to languages of India has been described in The Problem of a National Script for India, by D. Jones, which is obtainable in India from the Pioneer Press, Lucknow, and in England from Stephen Austin and Sons, Hertford, or from the Department of Phonetics, University College, London, W.C. 1. 1 The representation of the International Phonetic y in World Orthography has not yet been, settled, but y lias been suggested for it. This would seem to be a satisfactory solution, since the sounds represented by the International Phonetic y and q are not known to occur as separate phonemes in any language.

Principles of the I PA (1949) 357 by other members, and after consultations extending over more than two years the first version of the International Phonetic Alphabet was drawn up. It was published in ha fonetik titcar, August, 1888, together with a set of principles regarding its construction and its use. These were as follows : (1) There should be a separate letter for each distinctive sound ; that is, for each sound which, being used instead of another, in the same language, can change the meaning of a word. (2) When any sound is found in several languages, the same sign should be used in all. This applies also to very similar shades of sound. (3) The alphabet should consist as much as possible of the ordinary letters of the roman alphabet, as few new letters as should decide. (5) The new letters should be suggestive of the sounds they represent, by their resemblance to the old ones. (6) Diacritic marks should be avoided, being trying for the eyes and troublesome to write. It will be seen that with the exception of (5) and some special cases coming under (2), those principles still hold good to-day. (In regard to (5) it is now considered that letters should have unmistakable forms, and be as unlike each other as possible.) It will be observed too that (1) is an early statement of what we now call the “ phonemic ” principle of writing. In 1888, when the international character of the Association was formally recognised and when the first international alphabet had been designed, it was decided, as from January, 1889 : (1) to adopt French as the official language of the Association ; (2) to change the name of the society to L’ Association Phonetique des Professeurs de Langues Vivantes; (3) to change the title of the journal to Le Maitre Phonitique—the title which it has borne ever since. In 1897 the name of the society was altered once more, and it became known by its present title L'Association Phonetique Internationale. The original International Phonetic Alphabet of 1888 contained quite a number of the special letters used to-day, but it was imperfect in various respects. The Council has accordingly, since 1889, worked unremittingly to remedy defects, improving upon signs which proved unsatisfactory and extending the alphabet to provide for languages which had "

It is satisfactory to find that the work of the Association, extending as it does over more than sixty years, has met with considerable success. Its alphabet is now used for indicating pronunciation not only in the Association’s official publications, but also in numerous dictionaries and textbooks by authors unconnected with the Association in many countries. And even more important, some of the Association’s special letters are beginning to find their way into the common orthographies of some languages. 1 The Association considers that by encouraging the use of inter nationally recognised phonetic symbols for all languages its work contributes seriously to the creation and maintenance of cordial relations between peoples of different countries.

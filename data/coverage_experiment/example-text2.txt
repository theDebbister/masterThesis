Laurent, by now in the hall, with an engraving of Louis XVI mounting the
scaffold on one side of him and a bust of the Duc d'Enghien wreathed in
immortelles on the other, murmured, "This is indeed great news!" For he
seemed to remember having heard that in times inconceivably remote M.
de Vicq had been a suitor for the hand of Tante Bonne or was it that he
had been a flame of Tante Odile's? And, before he bowed respectfully
over the hands of his venerable relatives, he beheld a withered but
well-preserved old gentleman (yet younger, surely, by a decade than any
of them) rise from a chair at a disappointingly equal distance from all
of the old ladies . . . from Tante Odile's majestic piety and grey
curls, from Tante Clotilde's even greater majesty and even more denuded
(and therefore even more imposingly becapped) head, and from the
long-faded prettiness of Tante Bonne, the youngest, who wore the
smallest cap of any, and the least hideous cameo, and no jet at all, so
that Tante Clotilde had more than once been known to accuse this
eighty-year-old junior of hers of an ineradicable tendency to levity.

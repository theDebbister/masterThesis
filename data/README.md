### WikiPron
I used the WikiPron pronunciation dictionaries to train the models. Those have been 
used in the SIGMORPHON G2P [2020](https://github.com/sigmorphon/2020/tree/master/task1) and [2021](https://github.com/sigmorphon/2021-task1) tasks as well. For a few languages there exists a cleaned
version. 

### JIPA
The Journal of the IPA published *Illustrations of the IPA*. These
are short journal articles explaining the phonetics and phonology of one particular
language. Together with theoretical explanations comes a transcription. Mostly this is 
Aesop's short story *The North Wind and the Sun* that has been translated in many 
different languages. As those are human created texts, I used them to test the models
I created.

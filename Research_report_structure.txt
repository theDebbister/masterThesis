The structure of a research report
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Introduction:
- definition/description of the phenomenon
- research question: what do we want to find out about this phenomenon
- motivation: why does the world (or at least your research community) need
to know about your study

2. The goal:
- precise definition of what you try to achieve
- why this is not trivial

3. State of the art:
- what is already known about the phenomenon
- theories
- concepts
- the gap: what the others got wrong or missed (and your study will fix)

4. Your approach:
- your research question
- expected or possible answers (hypotheses)

5. Data and methods:
- what information (=data) you collect
- how you collect it
- how you organise the collected data
- what analyses you apply
- what tools you use to perform the analyses

6. Findings:
- counts, percentages, outcomes of statistical tests, often given in tables
or graphs
- descriptions of these tables and graphs
- and/or clear statements containing new facts established in your study

7. Interpretation:
- relate the findings to the starting expectations/hypotheses
- explain how your findings improve the knowledge about the phenomenon you
studied

8. Discussion:
- obstacles
- limitations
- alternative explanations - speculations
- broader relevance

9. Conclusion
- synthesis, the main message of your study
